(95)A (3)Hare (5)was (106)making (18)fun (11)of (1)the (4)Tortoise (87)one (83)day (13)for (112)being (97)so (96)slow. (109)"Do (12)you (89)ever (16)get (86)anywhere?" (6)he (103)asked (14)with (2)a (100)mocking (99)laugh. (98)"Yes," (69)replied (1)the (20)Tortoise, (66)"and (94)I (16)get (93)there (92)sooner (91)than (12)you (90)think. (54)I'll (88)run (12)you (2)a (10)race (9)and (85)prove (84)it." (7)The (3)Hare (5)was (82)much (81)amused (19)at (1)the (79)idea (11)of (78)running (2)a (10)race (14)with (1)the (20)Tortoise, (15)but (13)for (1)the (18)fun (11)of (1)the (76)thing (6)he (75)agreed. (74)So (1)the (73)Fox, (72)who (71)had (70)consented (8)to (68)act (67)as (118)judge, (65)marked (1)the (64)distance (9)and (63)started (1)the (62)runners (61)off. (7)The (3)Hare (5)was (60)soon (59)far (58)out (11)of (57)sight, (9)and (8)to (56)make (1)the (4)Tortoise (55)feel (17)very (53)deeply (52)how (51)ridiculous (50)it (5)was (13)for (49)him (8)to (48)try (2)a (10)race (14)with (2)a (47)Hare, (6)he (46)lay (45)down (44)beside (1)the (43)course (8)to (42)take (2)a (41)nap (40)until (1)the (4)Tortoise (39)should (38)catch (37)up. (7)The (4)Tortoise (36)meanwhile (35)kept (34)going (33)slowly (15)but (32)steadily, (31)and, (30)after (2)a (29)time, (28)passed (1)the (27)place (26)where (1)the (3)Hare (5)was (25)sleeping. (24)But (1)the (3)Hare (23)slept (22)on (17)very (121)peacefully; (9)and (117)when (19)at (122)last (6)he (119)did (113)wake (120)up, (1)the (4)Tortoise (5)was (116)near (1)the (102)goal. (7)The (3)Hare (80)now (101)ran (110)his (77)swiftest, (15)but (6)he (107)could (21)not (115)overtake (1)the (4)Tortoise (114)in (111)time. (7)The (10)race (104)is (21)not (105)always (8)to (1)the (108)swift.
